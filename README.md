# European-Employment-Data-and-Clustering-techniques

## Summary 

The European Employment data consists of the percentage employed in different industries in Europe countries during 1979. The purpose of examining this data is to get insight into patterns of employment (if any) in European countries in the time period of 1970s. The purpose of examining this data is to get insights into patterns of employment (if any) amongst European countries in 1970s

The original dataset was random sampled for 80% of the total datapoint. KMeans and Hierachical clustering techniques were applied to this random sampled data to categorize the countries into different clusters. The K Means procedure returned the optimal number of clusters as 3 whereas the hierarchical clustering returned the optimal number as 2


## Major Findings

Two clustering techniques were employed to study the employment pattern among European countries in 1970. The K Means clustering technique partitioned the dataset into 3 clusters- Developed countries, Under developed countries and developing countries. In Cluster 1 most of the population is either employed in service industry, social/personal services or manufacturing. In cluster 2 majority of the population is employed in agriculture industry and in cluster 3 most of the population is employed in agriculture or manufacturing industry. For the Hierarchical clustering procedure based on the dendrogram generated, we can cut the dendrogram to generate the clusters as per our choice. Since the optimal number was found to be 2 the dendrogram was cut to form two clusters.
